                        <p class="bio-text"> a hard rock band from the greater Chicago area. The band started in 2009 when brothers Matthew (guitar) and
                            David (vocals) Danaher were introduced to drummer John Eggan through a college friend.
                            The three bonded quickly over shared influences and began writing music and developing their sound.
                            After some early line up changes and recording frustrations, the trio released
                            their first EP, <i>Restitution</i>, in 2013.  They were soon joined by friend Ben Peterson
                            (bass) and began playing local Chicago clubs, suburban venues, and shows around the midwest. </p>
                        <p class="bio-text"> After performing at some of Chicago's most revered rock venues, including the House of Blues and the
                            iconic Metro, the band spent the latter part of 2015 recording their sophomore EP, <i>Judgement Is Coming</i>,
                            at Always Be Genius studios with producer Seth Henderson.  The EP was released in May of 2016 and
                            represents a huge step forward in both writing and performance quality.  <i>Judgement</i> explores a
                            range of themes from the driving single "Ararat", an apocalyptic song with overtones of Tool and the
                            Deftones to the hopeful and poignant finale, "Nero", which sounds more like Breaking Benjamin and gives a
                            subtle nod to Queen. Marwood's Fall is back performing around Chicago and seeking opportunities to share
                            their music with a wider audience.</p>
